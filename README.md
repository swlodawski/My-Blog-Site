# My-Blog-Site

I was asked to create a personal blog webpage with both a landing page and a popup blog content page. 
  1. On the landing page I was asked to create a header with a light/dark mode toggle.
  2. A body with both a blog picture section and a form section where the user can 
      enter multiple input values. Including a username, a title and blog content. 
  3. Additionally, in the form there would be a submit button that will direct the user
      to a page where the content will be shown.
  4. This is achieved by taking the user input values and setting them in 
      localstorage within the browser and then retrieving that input on the blog page 
      itself.
 5. On the blog content page in the header is a title, a back button, which can direct 
      the user back to the landing page and a light/dark mode toggle switch.
 6. Within the blog content page, the user input values will create new elements and 
      then append them to the document object so they appear on the screen.
 7. Lastly the footer will include a ul of my name, a short blog title and embedded 
      link to my portfolio repo which I created in challenge 2.


## Installation

1. I employed a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this project. 
   Additionally, I made use of the browser API to store the values inputted by the user 
   and then access those values on the blog content page.
2. I used gitpages to deploy this project so it could be viewed as a webpage.
3. I have included screenshots of my deployed page, both the landing page and blog 
   content page.
   Landing Page Light Mode: <img src="./assets/images/image.png>
   Landing Page Dark Mode: <img src="./assets/images/image-1.png>
   Content Page: <img src="./assets/images/image-2.png>
4. Additionally I have included the url to my deployed webpage. url: https://swlodawski.github.io/My-Blog-Site/


## Usage
1. This site can be used as a blog webpage to submit and post blog entry content.
